Hereâ€™s a prompt you can give to Copilot (or any code assistant) to update the font and styling of your Data Quality UI website:

***

Update the font and overall styling of my Angular Data Quality UI web application to make it look more modern and visually appealing. Please do the following:
- Change the default font to "Roboto", "Segoe UI", or a modern, clean sans-serif font throughout the site.
- Update button styles to have rounded corners, subtle hover effects, and a more prominent "Validate" button in a primary color.
- Add subtle shadow to the main content panels (like where the rules dropdown and metrics appear).
- Ensure headers use a bold, larger font size and clear spacing above and below.
- Update drop-down/select styles to look modern and consistent with the new overall design.
- Use a light neutral background color (e.g., #f7f9fa) for the page behind the content panels.
- Maintain professional branding, using blue accents where appropriate, but minimize dark blue background coverage for a lighter feel.
- Ensure all changes work well on both desktop and laptop screen sizes.

Please provide the updated CSS and example Angular component changes as needed.

This prompt clearly outlines modern design expectations, desired fonts, and attention to core UI elements while being actionable for an AI assistant or collaborator.
