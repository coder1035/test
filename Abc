The current project is a multi-module Gradle-based system consisting of three modules, all of which are part of the EDD (Enhanced Due Diligence) domain. A proposal has been made to add a fourth module related to a different domain — the GSP (Global Screening Platform) — within the same repository.

While this may seem convenient in the short term, it is important to evaluate the architectural, operational, and developmental implications of integrating an unrelated module into the existing codebase. This document aims to present a balanced view of the potential advantages and disadvantages of this approach, taking into account current project structure, future scalability, CI/CD pipelines, and containerization strategy.
