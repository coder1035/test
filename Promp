Update my React components and CSS so the website layout is fully responsive.
Ensure it looks good and scales correctly on mobile, tablet, laptop, and large desktop screens.
Use CSS Flexbox or Grid where appropriate, avoid fixed widths or heights, and add responsive breakpoints using media queries or a CSS framework if needed (like Tailwind or Bootstrap).
Also, make text, buttons, and tables adjust properly for smaller screens without horizontal scrolling.

Modify the layout so the website utilizes the full available width and height of the screen.
Remove unnecessary padding or margins that restrict the layout width.
Ensure the content adjusts dynamically to fill the viewport without leaving large empty areas on the sides or bottom.
Use flexible containers (like display: flex or grid) and width: 100% / height: 100vh where needed.
The layout should feel balanced and centered even on ultrawide screens.
